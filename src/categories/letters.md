title: "Letters"
description: "Formal advocacy to policymakers and decision-makers."
---
These are heavily researched, highly formal, and focused for a specific audience - usually policymakers or institutional decision-makers. When I write a letter, I'm not just making an argument; I'm making a case to someone with the power to act on it. The tone, evidence, and framing are tailored to be persuasive within the constraints and priorities of that audience. These are rarer than my other writing, reserved for issues where I believe direct appeal might actually move the needle.
