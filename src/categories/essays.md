description: "Structured arguments on complex problems."

These are my attempts to stake out defensible positions on complex problems. When I write an essay, I'm building an argument I believe should convince reasonable people - not just venting frustration or floating ideas. Essays here are more formal than my other writing - structured arguments with supporting evidence, not stream-of-consciousness or half-baked speculation. If I'm trying to change your mind about something important, it'll show up here.
