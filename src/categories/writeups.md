These document things I've worked on - the problems I encountered, the solutions I built, and what I learned along the way. Some are project retrospectives, some are technical deep-dives into specific challenges, and some are just me working through a problem in excruciating detail because I can't let it go. If you want to see how I actually approach problems - the dead ends, the pivots, the math - it's here. Less "here's what you should think" and more "here's what I did."
