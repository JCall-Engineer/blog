These are deep dives into answering specific questions, often AI-assisted. I'm trying to gather facts and sources, not make arguments - think of these as assembling the evidence before forming conclusions. What I present here is what I found, not what I think about it. If you're looking for my interpretation or policy positions, check the essays or letters instead.
